## Plan for the day:

* Lecture: What are simulations good for?
* Lecture: The logic of a simulation study.
* Practical exercise: A simple simulation of omitted variable bias.

**Lunch**

* Lecture: Simulation quantities of interest
* Lecture: Presenting simulation results
* Practical exercise: Conducting many simulations and creating a dataset of the quantities of interest

#### What are simulation studies?

* Lots of different meanings: including as a methodology in itself (e.g. spatial micro-simulation)
* Here, we are interested in using simulated data to test whether a model / a methodology works as we expect it to
* Difficult with real data, as we don’t know how it came about

]

--

.pull-right[

So: 

1. Take a dataset that we know the truth about
2. Run a model using that dataset
3. See whether the results that are produced are accurate
4. Repeat this multiple times to check results weren’t by chance.
5. See under what conditions the model is accurate

* To really understand what a model is really doing
* As a way of (re)learning basic statistics that we should know already, but don’t.

But...

* Simulations seem a bit artificial - how do we know they have anything to do with the real world.
* This was my attitude when a reviewer first asked me to conduct a simulation. (And it's not just me...)

# To what extent do simulations reflect reality? To what extent do they need to reflect reality?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

#### To what extent do they need to reflect reality?

My view: If a mathematical model can draw out interesting things about society (I think it can) then a mathematically simulated dataset can tell us interesting things about the model’s relation to real data.

That doesn’t mean models, or simulation, can tell us everything about the world: simulations as an important initial test

# What can be wrong with models?

* They give inaccurate answers on average (bias)
* They give correct answers on average, but with not as much precision as another model
* They give correct answers but the precision is inaccurately estimated
* They give the correct answer, but to a different question to what you thought
* A combination of the above

.pull-right[

If a model is biased… what is it biased from? And is that thing what we were really expecting to find?

&gt; Example: failing to control for ‘cultural differences’ in finding effect of race

Results should always be situated in some kind of reality!

# FE versus RE &amp; Age, Period Cohort Analysis

.pull-left[

### Fixed Effects and Random Effects

* Conventional wisdom: FE ‘gold standard’, RE affected by omitted variables
* But FE is limited (e.g no higher level variables can be estimated)
* Bell and Jones (2015) – shows RE with group means produces same results
* Also showed problems with SEs for FEVD

&lt;hr&gt;

**Result**: a change in advice of what researchers should do

*Bring into question results of some models (eg using the FEVD)*


]

--

.pull-right[

### Age-Period-Cohort Models

* Age = Period – Cohort, so model cannot include all three (exactly colinearity)
* Various proposed ‘solutions’ to the identification problem, and justified with simulations
* Bell and Jones (various) show situations where these models do not work (by changing the DGP used
in simulations

&lt;hr&gt;

**Result** A change in academic practice using these models?

# Summary

* These sorts of studies can have a big impact in challenging standard practice

## What really is a regression model anyway?

**Linear regression model:**

`$$Y = B_0 + B_1X_1 + e$$`

`\(B_1\)`: The average change in Y for a one-unit change in X. From a frequentist perspective, every repeat study of a given sample size will have some error in this value that is normally distributed around the true (population) value. 

From a Bayesian perspective, multiple values of `\(B_1\)` are plausible and these are usually normally distributed.

**Linear regression model:**

`$$Y = B_0 + B_1X_1 + e$$`

`\(X_1\)`: Our observations of the variable X from our sample will be the product of its own data generating process that results in a distribution, and will have some measurement error (e.g. a sample of incomes from the wider population will reflect a positively skewed normal distribution/log-normal distribution). 

Every set of values for X we get will look slightly different depending on who is in our sample and the error in our measurement.

**Linear regression model:**

`$$Y = B_0 + B_1X_1 + e$$`

`\(e\)`: Sometimes called the error, `\(e\)` can also be considered the considered the **unexplained residual** - that is, the difference between the true value of Y and that expected by the model. It is everything that cannot be predicted by `\(X_1\)`. In linear regression, it is assumed that `\(e\)` is normally distributed.

**Cornfield Conditions Study**:

* In the 1950s, many statisticians (including Karl Pearson) believed there was no good evidence that smoking caused cancer because an omitted, unmeasurable variable, whether someone has a **smoking gene** that makes them more likely to smoke and more likely to develop lung cancer, could exist.
* Jerome Cornfield demonstrated that the effect of such an omitted variable would have to be implausibly large in order to "explain away" the link between smoking and cancer.

# One simulation to many...

Now that you have a simulation that works (represents the underlying data generating process), we need to repeat it many, many, times, to see what happens. Some things to keep in mind:

* Can someone reproduce your results?
* Is there a clear description of what each part of your code is intended to do?
* What things do you actually want to vary, how much work will that be, and how fine-grained do the conditions need to be:
  * Sample size?
  * Relationship between confounder and outcome?
  * Relationship between confounder and predictor?
  * Both?
  * Distribution of the error terms?

# Best practice

1. Random is not truly random. Randomness is generated based on starting conditions. These can be set to be the same across several instances of a script by **setting a seed** that determines the randomness.
2. **Generate your data** using your simulation code
3. **Estimate your model**
4. **Save the results** for the things you're interested in (parameters, SEs, etc.)
5. **Repeat** with different randomness (re-sampling from the same data generating process)
6. **Repeat** under different conditions (different confounding effects, different sample sizes, etc.)

*Only change one thing at a time unless you're interested in how the two things interact with each other*.

# Exercise 1

In the first exercise, we'll be building up a simple simulation similar to the graph we've just looked at (an outcome (Y), a predictor of interest (X), and a confounder (Z)) and see **what happens to our estimates of our regression coefficient** if we exclude this confounder. We'll then look at how the strength of that confounder's relationship with the outcome affects that estimate.

You'll then be tasked with creating your own code seeing what happens if Z is a collider instead of a confounder, meaning a variable that is caused by both X and Y.

Fortunately, the distribution of our simulated results is exactly the uncertainty that our model should be estimating.

So we can compare our model’s estimated uncertainty (SE) to the variability of our simulations

`$$\text{Optimism} = 100 \times 
\frac{
  \sqrt{\sum_{l=1}^{\text{nsims}} (\beta^{(l)} - \bar{\beta})^2}

# Let's improve this...

* Add an active title.
* Get rid of extraneous information (bias is not the focus here).
* Minimise our ink-to-data/ink-to-information ratio.
* Consider the audience (are they likely to be familiar with simulation terms?)

# Presenting results

* It would be nice if someone had decided on some rules for simulations, and stuck to them.
* But they haven't.
* Which can be a really positive thing — you can be creative in how you display your results to do what you want the results to show.

# What could you do a simulation on?

* We’ve looked at the effect of confounders / colliders
* Could look at sample size (effectively do power analysis through simulation)
* What happens when you miss data’s multilevel structure?
* What do different missing data patterns do?
* Different model choices (Bayesian vs Frequentist, Poisson vs Negative Binomial, Fixed vs random effects, etc)

.pull-right[

# Limits of simulations

* Simulation studies don’t tell you for sure that models work well in real life
* Complex models will often struggle with messy real life data, but work OK with data designed as the model expects
* Can sometimes try to simulate messiness

# Judging simulation studies

* What are the situations being compared? Are they realistic?
* Do they apply to your dataset? Might things be different for you?
* Do they test all likely eventualities in the DGP (or do they miss something important)?
* There are lots of different ways to do simulations. We've only shown you one way, but others work too! 

# Tips 

* Be aware that some functions in some software will simulate "empirical" or "exact" simulated distributions rather than random simulated distributions (i.e. a simulated dataset that has values that return exactly the parameters specified), e.g. `corr2data` in Stata and with the `empirical = TRUE` argument in `faux` in R.

]

.pull-right[

* More complex simulation (e.g. multilevel data, multivariate data, time-series) might require additional packages, e.g. `faux`, `MASS` (in R) `simsum` in Stata, but not always (often there's a logic order to follow)
